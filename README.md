# Fashion-MNIST-Classification
Building a CNN model that classify images


### PROJECT OVERVIEW 
As a junior machine learning researcher at Microsoft AI, you have been assigned the task of classifying images using profile images to target marketing for different products. To prepare for this project, you will begin by working with the Fashion Mnist dataset in Keras and later adapt the code for user profile classification.

### PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Your assignment includes the following tasks:

<li>Convolutional Neural Network (CNN):</li>
Using Keras and classes in both Python and R, develop a CNN with six layers to classify the Fashion MNIST dataset.
<li>Prediction:</li>
Make predictions for at least two images from the Fashion MNIST dataset.

##### PROJECT STEPS:
<li>You import necessary libraries and the dataset</li>
<li>The dataset is loaded and divided into train and test dataset</li>
<li>The dataset is pre-processed by reshaping and normalizing it</li>
<li>Dataset is visualized to show the various classes/labels of the dataset</li>
<li>The CNN model is built with an input layer, 6 hidden layers and an output layer</li>
<li>Each layers has several inbuilt cnn layer with various filters  and activation functions </li>
<li>After defining the model's architecture, the model is then prepped for training by compiling it</li>
<li>The compile function preps the model for training by setting it's optimizer, the loss parameter and the evaluation parameter</li>
<li>The Model is then trained</li>
<li>The accuracy of the data is evaluated by checking how many images it can properly classify</li>
